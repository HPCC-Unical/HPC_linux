# Introduction to Vim

## Overview

**Vim** (Vi IMproved) is a highly configurable, powerful text editor built for efficient text editing. It is an improved version of the Unix editor `vi` and is ubiquitous on Unix systems.

While Vim has a steep learning curve, its efficiency and speed make it a favorite among programmers, sysadmins, and power users.

### A Brief History

Vim was created in 1991 by Bram Moolenaar as an extended version of the `vi` editor, which originated in 1976 as part of the early Unix operating system. The name "Vim" originally stood for "Vi IMitation," but it was later changed to "Vi IMproved" to reflect its added features and flexibility. Over the years, Vim has developed a loyal user base and an ecosystem of plugins and configurations, making it a robust choice for text editing.

Vim is included with many Unix-like systems and is available on all major operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### Use Cases for Vim

* **Software Development**: Write and edit code with syntax highlighting, macros, and powerful text manipulation commands.
* **System Administration**: Quickly edit configuration files over SSH sessions with minimal system resources.
* **Remote Editing**: Ideal for editing files on servers or embedded systems where GUI tools are unavailable.
* **Scripting**: Automate editing tasks using Vimscript or integrate with shell scripts.
* **Writing and Markdown Editing**: Many writers use Vim with plugins to write articles, books, and documentation.

### Why Learn Vim?

* **Always available:** Installed by default on most Unix-based systems.
* **Efficient:** Designed for minimal keystrokes and maximum speed.
* **Customizable:** Supports scripting, plugins, and extensive configuration.
* **Modal editing:** Enables powerful commands with fewer keys.
* **Lightweight:** Consumes minimal system resources, making it ideal for low-powered or remote environments.

# 1. Vim Basics

## Opening and Creating Files

```bash
vim filename.txt
```

* Opens `filename.txt` if it exists.
* If it doesnâ€™t exist, a new file is created.
* Vim starts in **Normal mode**, so typing immediately won't insert text until you switch modes.

To open Vim in read-only mode:

```bash
vim -R filename.txt
```

To open multiple files:

```bash
vim file1.txt file2.txt
```

Use `:n` and `:prev` to switch between them.

### Starting with Vim

You may see a welcome screen if you open Vim without a filename:

```bash
vim
```

To exit this screen, press `:q` + `Enter`.

It's good practice to use `vimtutor` when you're starting out. Just type `vimtutor` in your terminal for an interactive tutorial.

## Modes in Vim

Vim is a **modal editor**, which means it operates in different modes:

| Mode        | Purpose                                | Enter with         |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Normal**  | Navigate, delete, copy/paste, run cmds | `Esc`              |
| **Insert**  | Insert text (typing mode)              | `i`, `a`, `o`      |
| **Visual**  | Select and manipulate blocks of text   | `v`, `V`, `Ctrl-v` |
| **Command** | Enter commands like save, quit, search | `:`                |

### More on Modes

* **Normal mode** is where you perform actions: move the cursor, delete lines, copy and paste, etc.
* **Insert mode** allows you to type text, like any traditional editor.
* **Visual mode** lets you highlight text to manipulate blocks.
* **Command-line mode** (triggered by `:`) is used for operations like saving, quitting, searching, or global substitutions.

### Example Workflow

1. Open a file: `vim myfile.txt`
2. Press `i` to enter Insert mode and type something.
3. Press `Esc` to return to Normal mode.
4. Type `:w` to save, then `:q` to quit.

### Tip:

If Vim ever feels "stuck," press `Esc` repeatedly to return to Normal mode. You'll do this often!

You can also visualize your current mode in some enhanced Vim environments or when using certain configurations/plugins.

# 2. Basic Navigation

Navigation is key to using Vim effectively. Here are the most commonly used commands in **Normal mode**.

## Character Navigation

| Key | Action     |
| --- | ---------- |
| `h` | Move left  |
| `l` | Move right |

### Example:

Use `jjjj` to move down 4 lines.

## Word Navigation

| Key | Action              |
| --- | ------------------- |
| `w` | Next word           |
| `b` | Previous word       |
| `e` | End of current word |

### Example:

In a sentence, repeatedly pressing `w` jumps to each next word.

## Line Navigation

# 3. Insert Mode

Use insert mode to type text. Enter it from Normal mode using the following keys:

| `N`     | Repeat last search backward |

## Replacing

```vim
:%s/old/new/g
```

- Replace all occurrences of "old" with "new" in the file.
- Add `c` to confirm each: `:%s/old/new/gc`

---

# 7. Simple Configuration

Create or edit a `.vimrc` file in your home directory to customize Vim.

### Example Configuration:

```vim
set number          " Show line numbers
syntax on           " Enable syntax highlighting
set expandtab       " Use spaces instead of tabs
set tabstop=4       " Number of spaces per tab
set shiftwidth=4    " Indentation width
set autoindent      " Maintain indent on new lines
```

To apply changes, restart Vim or run `:source ~/.vimrc`.
