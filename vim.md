# Introduction to Vim

## Overview

**Vim** (Vi IMproved) is a highly configurable, powerful text editor built for efficient text editing. It is an improved version of the Unix editor `vi` and is ubiquitous on Unix systems.

While Vim has a steep learning curve, its efficiency and speed make it a favorite among programmers, sysadmins, and power users.

### Why Learn Vim?

- **Always available:** Installed by default on most Unix-based systems.
- **Efficient:** Designed for minimal keystrokes and maximum speed.
- **Customizable:** Supports scripting, plugins, and extensive configuration.
- **Modal editing:** Enables powerful commands with fewer keys.

# 1. Vim Basics

## Opening and Creating Files

```bash
vim filename.txt
```

- Opens `filename.txt` if it exists.
- If it doesn‚Äôt exist, a new file is created.

### Starting with Vim

You may see a welcome screen if you open Vim without a filename:

```bash
vim
```

To exit this screen, press `:q` + `Enter`.

## Modes in Vim

Vim is a **modal editor**, which means it operates in different modes:

| Mode        | Purpose                                | Enter with         |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Normal**  | Navigate, delete, copy/paste, run cmds | `Esc`              |
| **Insert**  | Insert text (typing mode)              | `i`, `a`, `o`      |
| **Visual**  | Select and manipulate blocks of text   | `v`, `V`, `Ctrl-v` |
| **Command** | Enter commands like save, quit, search | `:`                |

### Tip:

If Vim ever feels "stuck," press `Esc` repeatedly to return to Normal mode.

# 7. Simple Configuration (`~/.vimrc`)

Create or edit a `.vimrc` file in your home directory to customize Vim.

### Example Configuration:

```vim
set number          " Show line numbers
syntax on           " Enable syntax highlighting
set expandtab       " Use spaces instead of tabs
set tabstop=4       " Number of spaces per tab
set shiftwidth=4    " Indentation width
set autoindent      " Maintain indent on new lines
```

To apply changes, restart Vim or run `:source ~/.vimrc`.
